Interest Calculation in Banking (C Mini Project)
In this mini project, we'll extend the previous Bank Account Management System to include interest calculation. The program will calculate and apply interest to a bank account balance over time. For simplicity, weâ€™ll assume the interest is calculated annually, though it can be modified for monthly or quarterly compounding.

Project Features:
Interest Calculation: You will calculate interest based on the current balance and a fixed interest rate.
Account Operations: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money will be available alongside interest accumulation.
